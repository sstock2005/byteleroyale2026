# Byte-le 2026 Client Package

Welcome to Byte-le 2026!

In this package, you'll find:
- `launcher.pyz`, a Python zip archive used to interact with the server and run/visualize games locally
- boilerplate code for your bot in `base_client.py`
- utilities and class interfaces for editor autocomplete in the `game` module
- dependencies required to use the launcher in `requirements.txt`

See the [Getting Started](https://caitlinazazel.github.io/Byte-le-Engine-v2-2026/getting_started.html) section of the documentation to get started! 

If there are any questions, don't be afraid to message a developer in the Discord or call us over!
