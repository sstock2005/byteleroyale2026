How To Play
===========

Byte-le Royale 2026 is a Player vs Environment (PvE) survival game. Your objective is to explore the map, collect
resources, and survive while hostile bots attempt to stop you. Points are earned through collecting items and
unlocking new areas.

Winning and Losing
==================

Your goal is to score as many points as possible before being defeated by the bots. Points are earned by:

* Collecting **Coins**
* Collecting **Batteries**
* Collecting **Scrap**
* Activating **Generators** using Scrap gives you a flat, one-time bonus per generator
* Turning on **Generators**  increases your base multiplier, if the generators turn off that goes away

You lose the game if your character is caught enough times by a bot or if power hits 0.

Resources
=========

There are three main resources in the game:

================ ============================================================
Resource         Description
================ ============================================================
Coins            Grant points when collected
Batteries        Grant points and power when collected
Scrap            Used to activate generators and unlock new areas
================ ============================================================

Exploration
===========

The map contains multiple locked areas. These areas cannot be accessed until their connected generator has been
activated using Scrap. Exploring new areas allows access to more resources and increases your point multiplier.

Generators
==========

Generators are machines that must be powered using Scrap.

When a generator is activated:

* A new section of the map becomes accessible
* Your point multiplier increases
* More resources become available to collect

Generators require different amounts of Scrap depending on the area they unlock.

Point Multiplier
================

Your score is multiplied based on how many generators you have activated.

The more generators you power:

* The faster your score increases
* The more dangerous the map becomes
* The more bots may appear
* The multiplier is halved when in vents and 0 when in refuges

Survival and Bots
=================

Hostile bots roam the map and attempt to catch the player.
For more information, see :ref:`bot-quirks`.

* Bots patrol different areas of the map
* Some bots may chase the player if detected
* Getting caught by a bot ends the game

To survive:

* Keep moving
* Use the environment to avoid bots
* Unlock new areas to create escape routes
